Hello Sir,
I'm Zahid Hasan, Here is my working progress.
    1. First of all, I search for every topic and I learn what is it and how it works.
    2. I downloaded some of the required software. Such as sublime text 2, Python 2.7, PostgreSQL 12.
    3. After that, I learned how to create a database in PostgreSQL. Then I learned to do the insert, update, delete command in PostgreSQL. 
    4. I saw too many videos on youtube about flask framework.
    5. And lastly, I learned how to post on Github.
